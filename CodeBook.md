# Description of analysis

The original data was subset to only include the time domain versions of the means and standard deviations of the magnitudes of Body Acceleration, Gravity Acceleration, Body Jerk, Gyro Acceleration, and Gyro Jerk. The mean value of each of these is then computed for each subject and activity. The X, Y, and Z components of the vectors are not analyzed here since their contributions are included in the magnitude of the vector.
